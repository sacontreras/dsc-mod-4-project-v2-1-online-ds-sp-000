# Module 4 Final Project

**Problem of Choice**: *Image Classification with Deep Learning*


## Organization of Repository

### Jupyter Notebook(s)
There is only one notebook I needed to author for this project: [mod4-project.ipynb](mod4-project.ipynb), in the root directory.

Note that this notebook can and should be opened directly in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sacontreras/dsc-mod-4-project-v2-1-online-ds-sp-000/blob/master/mod4-project.ipynb) since the GPU runtime can be used if you wish to re-run the entire process yourself.  Without GPU, training will take a very long time.

### Executive Summary
This is the usual slide-based presentation, exported to PDF format: [ExecutiveSummary.pdf](ExecutiveSummary.pdf).

### Model Files
The model I create and train in has been saved at two checkpoints:
- the one with the best (highest) *validation accuracy* has been saved to [best_val_acc_model.hdf5](best_val_acc_model.hdf5)
- the one with the best (lowest) *validation loss* has been saved to [best_val_loss_model.hdf5](best_val_loss_model.hdf5)

### Remaining Files (images)
The remaining files are just images I used in my [ExecutiveSummary.pdf](ExecutiveSummary.pdf).
